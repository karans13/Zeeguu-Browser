        <h1>The Zeeguu Plugin</h1>
        <br/>
        ~Version: 1.280~
        <br/>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The plugin provides you with translations for
        the words that you are looking up. It also automatically
            uploads to your online profile the word, translation,
            and context if you save them. In this way, you can
            get later personalized exercises and better translations.
        </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> The next section assumes that you
                know what a zeeguu profile is, and that you have created
                an account on the Zeeguu website, installed the
                plugin locally, and declared a langauge that you
                are learning.
            </p>

        <h4>Translating Words in Pages</h4>
        <p>
            When you hold <b>Alt pressed</b> and <b>select a word</b>
            a popup appears with the corresponding
            translation as you can see in the figure below where the
            user has selected the German word Ãœber (which in English
            means About).
        </p>

        <p class="centeredImage">
        <img width="360px" src="../img/popup-menu.png"/><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> if you double-click a word, the entire word gets
            selected and this is faster than actually dragging
            the cursor to select.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are happy with the translation, and want to save
            the word to your online profile, click on the <b>save</b> link
            in the popup. The popup disappears, and the word with the translation
            are uploaded to your online profile.
        </p>




            <h4>Showing the Full Dictionary</h4>
        <p>
            If for some reason you are not convinced of the translation,
            or if you want more synonyms, and if you have alternative
            dictionaries installed for your language (TODO: link to
            section on installing dictionaries) you can click on the <b>More</b>
            link. This will pop-up a dictionary frame as in the figure bellow:
        </p>

            <p class="centeredImage">
                <img width="360px" src="../img/dictionary-frame.png"/><br/>
            </p>

        If in the full dictionary, you find a good translation,
        you can type it in the Translation field and then click the little
            cloud icon to the right to upload it to your profile. Next time
            you encounter that word, your favorite translation will be available!
            Cool, huh?


        <h4>Fast Mode</h4>
        <p>
            Since for some of us, holding Alt pressed to get
            a definition is too much. To be able to <b>translate a word
            only on selection without pressing Alt</b>, you can enable
            the <em>Fast Mode</em> from the popup menu as you can
            see in the figure below:
        </p>

            <p class="centeredImage">
        <img width="200px" src="../img/fast-mode.png"/>
        </p>

        <h2>Version History</h2>
            <h4>Version 1.280</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Refactored the interaction. Now using popups
                    with one word translation when available.</li>
                <li>First draft of this page.</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Version 1.270</h4>
            <p>Added a help button.</p>
            <p>
                When user clicks on the toolbar button
                and the user must login, the redirect
                opens the popup instead of the dictionary.
