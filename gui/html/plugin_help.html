        <h1>The Zeeguu Plugin</h1>
        <!--<br/>-->
        <!--~Version: 1.280~-->
        <!--<br/>-->

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The plugin provides you with translations for
        the words that you are looking up. It also automatically
            uploads to your online profile the word, translation,
            and context if you save them. In this way, you can
            get later personalized exercises and better translations.
        </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> The next section assumes that you
                know what a zeeguu profile is, and that you have created
                an account on the Zeeguu website, installed the
                plugin locally, and declared a langauge that you
                are learning.
            </p>

        <h4>Translating Words in Pages</h4>
        <p>
            When you hold <b>Alt pressed</b> and <b>select a word</b>
            a popup appears with the corresponding
            translation as you can see in the figure below where the
            user has selected the German word Ãœber (which in English
            means About).
        </p>

        <p class="centeredImage">
        <img width="360px" src="../img/popup-menu.png"/><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>ProTip:</b> The fastest way to select a word is to double-click it.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are happy with the translation, and want to save
            the word to your online profile, click on the <b>save</b> link.
            The popup disappears, and the word together with the translation
            are uploaded to your online profile.
        </p>




        <h4>Showing the Full Dictionary</h4>
        <p>
            If for some reason you are not convinced of the translation,
            or if you want more synonyms, and if you have alternative
            dictionaries installed for your language (TODO: link to
            section on installing dictionaries) you can click on the <b>More</b>
            link. This will pop-up a dictionary frame as in the figure bellow:
        </p>

            <p class="centeredImage">
                <img width="360px" src="../img/dictionary-frame-ann.png"/><br/>
            </p>

            <p>
        If in the full dictionary, you find a good translation,
        you can type it in the Translation field and then click the little
            cloud icon to the right to upload it to your profile. Next time
            you encounter that word, your favorite translation will be available!
            Cool, huh?
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>ProTip</b>: you don't actually have to type the translation; it is
            sufficient that you select the corresponding word in the dictionary
            window and the translation box will be filled automatically).
            </p>

        <h4>Your Words Highlighted</h4>
        <p>
            The words that you have looked up in the past are highlighted
            in every page that you visit as exemplified in the picture
            below. We are working on having different colors for words
            that you have already learned and words that you don't know
            very well yet.
        </p>
            <p class="centeredImage">
                <img width="440px" src="../img/highlighting-words.png"/><br/>
            </p>



        <h4>The Toolbar</h4>

            <p>
                The second way in which you can interact with the
                Zeeguu plugin is via the Toolbar accessible when you
                click the Zeeguu icon in the browser toolbar.

                The figure bellow shows the toolbar. The first thing that
                you should see is that the toolbar provides you with
                a search box. You can thus search for words here, not only
                by highlighting them in the page.
            </p>

            <p class="centeredImage">
                <img width="200px" src="../img/fast-mode.png"/>
            </p>

            <p>

            The toolbar also contains a series of action buttons.
            In order from left to right, their associated actions
            are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Display your word list</li>
                    <li>Open the <em>Language Gym</em> with vocabulary exercises</li>
                    <li>Temporarily disable links in current page. Useful for selecting text inside links</li>
                    <li>Toggle <em>Fast Mode</em> in which you don't need to press Alt for translations</li>
                    <li>Show the plugin settings page with info about user account, dictionaries, etc.</li>
                    <li>Display this help page</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
